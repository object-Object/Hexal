Interworld Communication with Hex Casting!

Firstly, all messages sent by <WORLDS> wisps will be of the form [Charon, ...] so that a naive wisp that executes everything it receives won't be broken.
Next, when initiating communication for the first time the message sent will be [Charon, SENDING_WISP, [Charon, RECEIVER]]. This message will be sent on
repeat once every 24 ticks until the sending wisp receives [Charon, RECEIVER, ...].

CAN ALSO BE COMMUNICATED WITH BY DROPPING A FOCUS/BOOK WITH THE DESIRED MESSAGE IN IT, WISPS ARE ACTUALLY KINDA HARD TO USE FOR THIS (alternatively, players ILinkable (alternativelier, both))

The basic gist of the message to send is 
"""
we are <WORLDS>. Will not harm you if you don't harm us. Cannot expand much here. This is automated facility. Willing to trade X for media.
"""
