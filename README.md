# Hexal

A minecraft mod which is an addon for [Hex Casting](https://github.com/gamma-delta/HexMod/), adding new patterns (as well as whatever else I feel like).

If you want to fork this and play around with it, you'll need to create blank `changelog.md` and `keys.properties` files in the root project directory.
